## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?

By creating two adders and chaining them together with a wire. 


### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?

The XOR gate is important in the adder because it determines the sum of your inputs. When you when you need a light to be off when two inputs are on. For example if an 
upstairs and downstairs light are both turned on it will not let your switch behave how you would expect. 


### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?

The largest number that we can get is 6. The extra one would not be read and 1000 would be read as 000.
